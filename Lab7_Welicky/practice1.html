	Hello! My name is Josh Welicky.<br><br>

	You can contact me through my KU email joshuawelicky@ku.edu, or through my 
	personal email joshuawelicky@gmail.com.<br><br>

	I have experience working in the programming languages Python, C, and C++. I acquired these
	skills through taking the following courses: Programming 1(EECS 169), Programming 2(EECS 268),
	and Software Engineering(EECS 348). I am also involved with the KU chapter of IEEE.<br><br>

	I have only had one paying job. I am a front end sales associate at Walmart.<br><br>

	I have worked on a number of projects. I am currently working to develop an arithmetic 
	expression evaluator for EECS 348. With members of IEEE, I am working on an technologically
	interactive board game. I am also working on a primitive chat bot as a personal project. <br><br>
